This is the companion application to the paper:

[Strike (with) a pose: Neural networks are easily fooled by strange poses of familiar objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11553). arXiv 1811.11553. 2018.

 The application allows you to generate adversarial poses of objects with a graphical user interface. Please note that the included jeep object (freely available [here](https://free3d.com/3d-model/jeep-10771.html)) does not meet the realism standards set in the paper. Unfortunately, the school bus object shown in the GIF is proprietary and cannot be distributed with the application.

 If you use this application for your own research, please cite:

## Requirements

* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (Linux users only)
* **OpenGL** &ge; 3.3 (many computers satisfy this requirement)
  * On Linux, you can check your OpenGL version with the following command (requires `glx-utils` on Fedora or `mesa-utils` on Ubuntu):
  ```bash
  glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"
  ```
  * On Windows, you can use [this tool](https://community.esri.com/groups/technical-support/blog/2012/03/15/what-version-of-opengl-do-i-have-and-do-i-have-the-latest-drivers-for-my-system).
* **Python 3** ([Mac](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.7/python-3.6.7-macosx10.9.pkg), [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.7/python-3.6.7-amd64.exe))
  * **Mac** users might also have to [install SSL certificates for Python](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42334357/1316276) by double-clicking the file found at:
  ```bash
  /Applications/Python\ 3.x/Install\ Certificates.command
  ```
  where `x` is the minor version of your particular Python 3 install. If you used the above link to install Python, the file will be at:
  ```bash
  /Applications/Python\ 3.6/Install\ Certificates.command
  ```
  * **Windows** users should make sure they [select the option to "Add Python 3.x to PATH"](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installation-steps) where "x" is the minor version of the Python 3 you are installing. If you forget to select this option, you can also [add Python to the PATH yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/using-pip-on-windows/5).

## Install/Run

Note: the application takes a little while to start the first time it's run because it has to download the neural network.

### Linux

In the terminal, enter the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the strike-with-a-pose repository.
git clone https://github.com/airalcorn2/strike-with-a-pose.git
# Move to the strike-with-a-pose directory.
cd strike-with-a-pose
# Install strike-with-a-pose.
pip3 install .
# Run strike-with-a-pose.
strike-with-a-pose
```

You can also run the application (after installing) by starting Python and entering the following:

```python
from strike_with_a_pose import app
app.run_gui()
```

### Mac

1. Click [here](https://github.com/airalcorn2/strike-with-a-pose/archive/master.zip) to download the application ZIP.
2. Extract the ZIP somewhere convenient (like your desktop).
3. Double-click `install.command` in the `strike-with-a-pose-master/` directory.
  * Note: you may have to [adjust your security settings](https://www.mcvsd.org/tips/powerteacher/osx_unidentified_developers.html) to allow applications from "unidentified developers".
4. Double-click `strike-with-a-pose.command` in the `strike-with-a-pose-master/run/` directory.

### Windows

1. Click [here](https://github.com/airalcorn2/strike-with-a-pose/archive/master.zip) to download the application ZIP.
2. Extract the ZIP somewhere convenient (like your desktop).
3. Double-click `install.bat` in the `strike-with-a-pose-master\` directory.
 * Note: you may need to click "More info" and then "Run anyway".
4. Double-click `strike-with-a-pose.bat` in the `strike-with-a-pose-master\run\` directory.

## For Experts

Users can test their own objects and backgrounds in `strike-with-a-pose` by ***(1)*** modifying [`settings.py`](https://github.com/airalcorn2/strike-with-a-pose/blob/master/strike_with_a_pose/settings.py), ***(2)*** adding the associated files to the `scene_files/` directory, and ***(3)*** running the following inside the `strike-with-a-pose/` directory:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=strike_with_a_pose python3 -m strike_with_a_pose.app
```

Pressing **L** will toggle **Live** mode. When on, the neural network will continuously generate predictions. Note, **Live** mode can cause considerable lag if you do not have each of ***(1)*** a powerful GPU, ***(2)*** [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive) installed, and ***(3)*** a [PyTorch version with CUDA](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) support installed.

Pressing **X** will toggle the object's **teXture**. This is useful for making sure the directional light is properly interacting with your object. If the light looks funny, swapping/negating the vertex normal coordinates can usually fix it. See the script below for an example.

```python
input_f = "frame.obj"
output_f = "frame_new.obj"

lines = open(input_f).read().strip().split("\n")
out = open(output_f, "w")
for line in lines:
    if line[:2] == "vn":
        parts = line.split()
        # Play around with this line.
        (parts[2], parts[3]) = (parts[3], str(-float(parts[2])))
        line = " ".join(parts)

    print(line, file=out)

out.close()
```
